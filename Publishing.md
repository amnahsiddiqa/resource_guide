## Findable and Accessible: Where to publish?

* As a supplement: simple but not not standardized and easy to overlook, lose, and mishandle  
https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/the-push-to-replace-journal-supplements-with-repositories--66296

* As a separate product:  
Increases accessibility and reproducibility, promotes detailed descriptions as well as credit  
  A DOI-issuing repository is better than URL for permanency  
  A registry of repositories: https://www.re3data.org/  
  Examples:  
    * Mendeley: centralized data repository, minimal description, not standardized  
    * Dryad: centralized data repository with peer review  
    * ResearchGate: social media for scientists  
    * Data-in-Brief: thorough and standardized description of data and methods  
    * MethodX: the nitty-gritty of the methods (computational and experimental)  
    * Github: for code mostly  
    * Zenodo: for development and review as well as publication, integrates with github
