## How do I go back from my current state to a snapshot made on a certain commit?
there are two types of commands and you should be careful in making selection to any one of them based on their purpose. 
`git revert and git reset` 

- I will explain reset as a rewind call. so you make a call to back to a place in your whole branch timeline to a certain commit and everything (all the changes you made after that)will be gone from that point onwards.

- Git revert on the other hand  undoes changes made in a given commit, creating a commit which is reverse (well, reciprocal) of a given commit. 

```
(base) âžœ  test_demo2 git:(main) âœ— git reset 3bbe6d4 --hard
#HEAD is now at `sha key of commit` Initial commit
(base) âžœ  test_demo2 git:(main) âœ— git reset --soft "HEAD@{1}"
(base) âžœ  test_demo2 git:(main) âœ— git commit -m "Revert to 3bbe6d4 "

```



## Add issues and  commits for better collaboration  

- use the number of issue to close or fix the issue or get help
- use issues to get help from somebody else 

## A commit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) key:

- Commonly referred to as a "commit hash" or "commit SHA-1," is a unique identifier for a specific commit in a version control system, such as Git. It's a cryptographic hash value that's generated from the contents of the commit and the commit's metadata. The commit SHA key is used to uniquely identify and reference a particular state or snapshot of a repository at a specific point in time.
