This project provides an overview of the various computational resources we use at the Hagan Lab and how to get started with them, as well as some best-practice guidelines for promoting reproducibility. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial, but more of a continuously-evolving road map. You're welcome to contribute and/or provide any feedback either through the github repository or via email.
